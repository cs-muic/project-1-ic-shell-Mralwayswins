# project-1-ic-shell-Mralwayswins
For this project I reference over hundreds of websites so listing them out individualy is almost impossible and that would also waste the time of the graders so I will only list the name of the website and refrain from naming each individuals. I did not reference any other already formed shells so there would not be those listed here.

Main websites that I referenced are:
-Stackoverflow
-TutorialsPoint
-GeeksforGeeks
-Linuxquestions
-Linux man page
-IBM Documentation
-Experts Exchange
-Quora
-JournalDev
-Unix & Linux Stack Exchange
-nixCraft
-The resources on Canvas
and many more. I do appologize for not listing everything out, but there is just too much info to list out that this file would surpass the code of this assignment so I dropped it.
